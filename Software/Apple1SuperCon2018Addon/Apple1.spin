'' This little project is a proof-of-concept that shows that a Propeller and
'' a WDC 65C02 are enough to emulate/replicate an Apple 1. 
''
'' The Propeller generates a 1MHz clock signal to the PHI2 input of the
'' 65C02, and it reads the address bus to find out where the 65C02 wants to
'' read or write data. It manipulates the data bus to emulate RAM, ROM and
'' I/O devices.
''
'' The !NMI, !IRQ, !SO and RDY pins are pulled high. The Reset pin is pulled
'' high but has a pushbutton switch to ground.
''
'' A PS/2 keyboard can be connected to the usual pins P26-P27, in the same
'' way as on the Propeller Demo board. There aren't enough pins for a full
'' TV output, but we can use the 1-pin TV driver from the Parallax Forums
'' to generate a monochrome video signal. The clock signal for the 65C02 is
'' generated on the same pin as the SCL clock signal to the EEPROM; this
'' won't harm the EEPROM as long as we keep SDA high.
''
'' The code that runs on the Propeller emulates ROM and RAM in the hub. But
'' because there's not enough space in the hub, the amount of ROM and RAM
'' that are available are limited. It's possible to connect an SRAM chip
'' (e.g. a 62256) to the bus, and turn the RAM emulation off, to overcome
'' this problem.
