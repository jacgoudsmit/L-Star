'' the EEPROM. The EEPROM won't activate and won't interfere, as long as we
'' keep the SDA line high.

'' If the Propeller is running at 80MHz (5MHz crystal), the maximum frequency
'' for the 65C02 is 1MHz (1_000_000). If you use a faster crystal, you can
'' run the 65C02 at a faster frequency too. For example, a 6.25MHz crystal
'' runs the Propeller at 100MHz (25% overclocked), you can run the 65C02
'' at 1.25MHz (1_250_000).

  ' Initialize the clock and SDA pins as output, and set them both high for now,
  ' so that the 6502 access cogs can ready themselves by waiting for CLK0 to go low.
