'' This module allows the 65C02 to access hub memory of the Propeller as
'' regular ROM and/or RAM.
''
'' The module uses one cog to map a hub memory area that start with ROM and
'' ends with RAM, into the 65C02 address space. Either ROM or RAM area can
'' be zero bytes (in order to map only ROM or only RAM), and it's possible
'' and easy to make the mapping wrap around the end of 6502 address space,
'' so that the ROM maps to the high addresses and the RAM maps to low
'' addresses. That way, for many simple 6502 systems, only one cog is needed
'' to map all the necessary memory.

'' Parameters:
'' - RomStart: word
''   Hub address of the start of the ROM area to map into 65C02 address
''   space. In most cases, you would use a FILE command in a DAT section
''   to load a ROM image file to map into memory.
'' - RomEndRamStart: word
''   Hub address of the end of ROM and/or the start of RAM. If no ROM is
''   needed, set this pointer to the same address as RomStart
'' - RamEnd: word
''   Hub address of the end of RAM. If no RAM is needed, set this pointer
''   to the same address as RomEndRamStart.
'' - Offset6502: word
''   Start address in 65C02 address space where the memory should be mapped.
'' - ResetVector: word
''   If this parameter is nonzero, the cog simulates a reset by feeding BRK
''   instructions to the 65C02 at startup time until it picks up the IRQ/BRK
''   vector. The value of this parameter is fed to the 65C02 as reset vector,
''   after which normal operation commences.
